# Proposal for C++ Code Development Occlusion Culling

## Objective:

To develop an efficient C++ - based Occlsuion Culling toolkit for real-time 3D rendering and visualization. The goal is to optimize scene rendering by eliminating unnecessary computations for objects that are not visible, enhancing performance in applications such as game engines, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and large-scale simulations.

## Background:

Occlusion culling is a critical technique in computer graphics and robotics that reduces the rendering workload by excluding objects obstructed from view. Traditional rendering pipelines often waste computational resources by processing occluded objects, leading to reduced efficiency in large 3D environments.

By leveraging modern C++ optimizations, GPU acceleration (OpenGL/Vulkan; Optional), and spatial partitioning techniques, this project aims to develop a robust solution that dynamically determines visible objects in complex scenes.

## Scope:
1. Scene Representation & Acceleration Structures
- Implement efficient Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) and Octrees for spatial partitioning.
- Integrate Hierarchical Z-Buffer (HZB) and Depth Buffer techniques for visibility determination.
- Support common 3D scene formats (OBJ, FBX, PLY).
2. Real-Time Occlusion Culling Algorithms
- Hardware-Based Occlusion Queries (OpenGL/Vulkan) for GPU-accelerated visibility checks.
- Software-Based Hierarchical Culling, using CPU-optimized depth testing.
- Hybrid Techniques combining frustum culling and occlusion culling for optimal performance.

## Deliverables
1. C++ Occlusion Culling Library with:
- Optimized scene management and occlusion query system.
- Support for both CPU-based and GPU-based culling techniques.
2. Example Demos & Benchmarks, including:
- Real-time visualization of occlusion culling efficiency.
- Comparisons between different culling methods.
- Comprehensive Documentation for easy integration.
